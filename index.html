              I have started to attempt to load assests for my project. However, there have been issues that prevent me
              from doing this. When I try to load the school unity, the assets will not load. It is the 2017.4.14f1
              version, the recommended version.
            </p>
            <p>
              On my mac, I have downloaded the latest version, the 2018.3.4f1 version. I have installed assets on it,
              however, the game will not play when I click the play button.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will try to install the recommended version onto my mac and also try to run the project on my home pc. I
              will try to sinc the versions and use the same version by storing the project onto a USB. When I get past
              the issues, I am confident that my project
              will turn out well as I have many ideas for it.

              The past few days I have been working on my game and have gone very far in progress. I decided to not do
              my original idea as it was too complex and difficult. I am trying to think up of ideas to do for my

              Today I made extra levels for my game. I have almost finished and will add sound to my game soon. I am
              aiming to create twenty levels, with difficulty going up with each. I am very happy with the design of my
              game. I have also started creating my website

              I added a couple of levels to my game today. The levels are getting long so I have decided to have a total
              of fifteen levels, a nice, rounded number. I have drawn sketches for stages of the game that I want to
              create.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have yet added sound, which I will do either on the weekends or the next lesson. When I have finished
              this, I will move on to bug testing, making the game difficulty perfect, getting opinions of others in
              order to improve my game and finishing my website.

          <p>My game turned out mostly successful as I finished it weeks before it was due and ran into minimal problems
            along the journey. Although I have edited many items in the project, it was worth it to persevere and
            improve my game into what it is today.
          </p>

          <p>At the start of the project, I had a plan of creating a unique first-person adventure game where you would
            have to hunt for objects and get destroyed by stepping in the wrong places. I browsed the
            <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/" target="_blank">unity store</a> and was planning on using
            <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/search?q=liteland&k=liteland" target="_blank">LiteLand</a> for the
            ground and
            <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/kira-  stylized-character-100303"
              target="_blank">Kira</a> for my player model, with other textures and models to complete it. I drew
            sketches of the game and planned a storyboard.
          </p>

          <p>However, the assets wouldn’t load and I quickly realised that I would have to come up with a different idea
            in order to pass the project. I looked up unity tutorials and watched many before I came across one for a
            game idea I liked, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik" target="_blank">Blockathon</a>.
            This was very different from my original idea but the tutorial explained everything in great detail and
            deepened my understanding of unity. </p>

          <p>I changed some settings in the game from the original design such as the fonts and colour schemes. I also
            added a “level” label which tells you what level you are on, something that wasn’t featured in the original
            tutorial. I added sound and sound
            effects from a different tutorial and featured them in my project. Errors came up for this but I fixed them
            and made sure that sound was running in my game. I also added an advanced pause menu from a completely
            different tutorial, utilising
            the most out of unity.</p>

          <p>I created my website using CodePen when website makers such as
            <a href="https://www.weebly.com" target="_blank">Weebly</a> and <a href="https://www.wix.com"
              target="_blank">Wix</a> were recommended. I used HTML, Javascript and CSS to design my website which
            increased my experience in Web Design. This experience
            can be used in further job opportunities. Overall, my game functioned as intended although it didn’t match
            the original game idea. I am extremely satisfied with my final ending result.</p>
